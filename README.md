# YOLO-Paper-Replication
## Description
This repository contains the code for recreating the You Only Look Once (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) paper. Where I have used the library MMDetection for loading the models.
Here, we also did a comparision between RCNN and YOLO architecture on their AUC metric.
